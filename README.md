# OpenAI Agents SDK Explorer

A curated exploration of the OpenAI Agents SDK - features, examples, and documentation.

## Overview

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a toolkit designed to simplify the creation and coordination of AI agents. This repository serves as a guide to understanding and utilizing the key components of the SDK.

## Quick Start

Get started quickly with our [Quickstart Example](docs/quickstart-example.md) that shows how to create and run simple agents.

## Key Components

### Core Components

- **Agents** - The central abstraction that encompasses instructions and tools.
- **[Handoffs](docs/handoffs-guide.md)** - Mechanisms for transferring control between agents.
- **[Tools](docs/tools-guide.md)** - Functions and capabilities available to agents.
- **Runner** - Engine for executing agents and managing their workflow.

### Monitoring & Observability

- **[Tracing](docs/tracing-guide.md)** - Comprehensive tracing capabilities for monitoring agent behavior.
- **Results & Streaming** - Managing agent outputs and streaming responses.

### Advanced Features

- **Context Management** - Managing state across agent interactions.
- **[Guardrails](docs/guardrails-guide.md)** - Safety and control mechanisms for agent behavior.
- **Model Settings** - Configuring underlying models.

## Getting Started

To get started with the OpenAI Agents SDK:

1. Install the SDK using pip:
   ```
   pip install openai-agents
   ```

2. Try the [Quickstart Example](docs/quickstart-example.md) to create your first agent.

3. Explore the documentation in this repository to understand the key concepts.

4. Check out the [Multi-Agent System Example](docs/example-multi-agent-system.md) for a more advanced implementation.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents to handle complex tasks
- **Agent Handoffs**: Enable seamless transitions between agents
- **Tool Integration**: Connect agents to external systems and functions
- **Safety Controls**: Implement guardrails to ensure appropriate agent behavior
- **Comprehensive Tracing**: Monitor and debug agent interactions
- **Streaming Support**: Process agent outputs in real-time
- **Context Management**: Maintain state across agent interactions
